## Project Description

Due to corona crisis most business depending on the tourism have been strongly hitted. One of the sectors is the accomodation and hospitality. 
In this project we analise data from airbnb from Amsterdam to see how the accomodations, bookings and prices have been affected.
We will try to see as well, which are the better places to have a Airbnb location in the city and which factors are influencing that.
This will be a exploratory analysis to get some insights.


## Questions & Goals

1. Find the best district to have a airbnb accommodation:
Characterise the Airbnb distribution of accommodations, bookings and prices by district 
See the impact of criminality and green spaces on those distribution


2. Find the best type of rental:
 Analysis of the bookings by type of rental before and during corona time


3. Find out if the bookings are recovering at this moment
Analysis of the bookings and locations before and during corona time
Analysis of the evolution of prices before and during corona time

## Dataset

The data consists of several data sets.
 
The data sets from Aribnb haven been download from their official open data source. This data is just available for the las 365 days.
The older data was obtained from Kaggle rom people who perform studies on the previous years.
Those data sets were combined.
One has information about the different accommodations and its features as type of accommodation, total number of reviews, average reviews per month, location gps coordinates, neighbourhood location between other.
A second data set contains all the dates when a review was entered and the id of the accommodation from December 2018 till now. 
The last one of the Airbnb data sets consists of a daily price, daily availability per accommodation. We have this information from December 2018 till December 2020 and from April 2021 till July 2021.


A second set of data sets are the ones obtain from de data open source from the city Hall of Amsterdam. 
There is a data set with information about the crimes per district for the last 4 years and another that gives us information about the green areas as well per district.
A third data set was needed to define in which district was located the neighbourhoods of the listings data set from Airbnb.

- Stage 2: Celaning the data and starting the first analysis
- Stage 3: Finalizing analysis, creating visualizations and first draft on the technical report and presentation.
- Stage 4: Finalizing technical report and presentation.

Repository:
- folder with all clean data (raw data is too heavy to have at GITHUB)
- folder with visualizations
- Folder with all the documentation: two jupyter notebooks, one with the steps followed and the code for cleaning the data and another with the code for the analysis and the plot that were done with Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python. It includes as well, the presentation.
